# Multiple-linear-regression-model
Analysis of 50 Companies and creation a model using multiple linear regression that'll tell the venture capitalist fund which type of companies it is supposed to be most interested in and their main criteria is profit. I'll chose an initial significance level, say 5% (0.05) and then use the method of backward elimination. Then, with the help of step-by-step regression, I'll remove the predictors which are less statistically significant, that is, the ones with the highest P-values. By the end of the process, I'll be left with the predictor which is supposedly the most significant one(here, according to sample dataset, R&D spend) which is more likely to have an higher impact on profit than the other parameters.
